# Advent of Python 2017

(Solutions for [AoC17](adventofcode.com/2017))

These are my first solutions for *Advent Of Code 2017*.
I've done a couple of thing with python already, so this is for learning some new high-level-tricks rather than for learning a language.
However, if you see something within the code that grinds your gears, feel free to point it out with a pull request. ;-)

I'm also trying to solve the tasks [using Rust](github.com/turysaz/advent_of_rust_2017), which I barely know at all.
